private link
vpc endpoints 2 types
1. interface endpoint -- remaining all services interface endpoints
2. gateway endpoint --- s3,dynamodb

vpc peering : limit is 5
there is no way to tracking so advance version for it is aws transit gateway

STNO will use transit gateway

event bridge
sns 
sqs
stepfunctions'
lambda


learn complete vpc peering networking concepts

cloud watch will do basic monitoring like infratruture monitoring and application monitoring
cloud trail will api actions
